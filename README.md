The objective of this study is to use a random forest classifier to predict diabetes. The goal is to create a model that can accurately recognize people who are at risk for diabetes based on a variety of demographic and medical characteristics. Because it can capture complicated interactions between predictors and produce reliable predictions, the random forest method is used. Age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, heart disease, smoking habit, HbA1c level and blood glucose level are the factors in the dataset. The random forest model has been tested and shown to have great accuracy in predicting diabetes. The feature importances draw attention to the important predictors, such as HbA1c level, blood glucose level, age, BMI and smoking history. This study advances the use of machine learning to detect diabetes and offers insights for preventive healthcare interventions and individualized management approaches.
